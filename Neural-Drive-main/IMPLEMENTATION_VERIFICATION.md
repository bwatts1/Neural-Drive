# Implementation Verification Report ✅

## Files Created

- ✅ `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` - Created with bottom nav (Home + Profile)
- ✅ `lib/screens/profile_screen.dart` - Created with user settings
- ✅ `lib/main.dart` - Updated with NeuralDriveApp, proper routing

## Code Quality

- ✅ No missing imports
- ✅ No linter errors (verified with read_lints)
- ✅ Uses NavigationBar (Material 3) for bottom navigation
- ✅ Cards have rounded corners (16px) using RoundedRectangleBorder
- ✅ No commented-out code blocks
- ✅ const used where possible

## Implementation Details

### HomeScreen (lib/screens/home_screen.dart)
- ✅ StatefulWidget with _tabIndex state management
- ✅ Uses Material 3 NavigationBar with two destinations
- ✅ Dashboard tab (_HomeTab) shows:
  - Welcome card ("Welcome back!")
  - Upcoming Maintenance section with placeholder data
  - Recent Activity section with placeholder data
- ✅ Helper widgets: _ReminderTile, _ActivityTile with severity colors
- ✅ Imports ProfileScreen for Tab 1

### ProfileScreen (lib/screens/profile_screen.dart)
- ✅ Header card with mock user (Alex Driver, alex@example.com)
- ✅ Preferences card with:
  - Odometer Unit (Miles)
  - Notifications (enabled)
  - Currency (USD)
- ✅ Account card with:
  - Backup / Export Data
  - Sign Out (styled in red)
- ✅ Uses CustomScrollView with SliverAppBar

### Main App (lib/main.dart)
- ✅ Renamed MyApp to NeuralDriveApp
- ✅ Material 3 theme with blue color scheme
- ✅ initialRoute = HomeScreen.routeName
- ✅ All routes registered (including existing Splash, Login, SignUp, MaintenanceLog)
- ✅ Notification setup preserved from original code

### Routing Updates
- ✅ login.dart imports HomeScreen and navigates via routeName
- ✅ maintenance_log.dart imports new screens
- ✅ Old home_screen.dart and profile_screen.dart removed from lib/

- ✅ Preferences section:
  - Odometer Unit, Notifications toggle, Currency
- ✅ Account section:
  - Backup/Export, Sign Out buttons

### Existing Features Preserved
- ✅ Splash screen still accessible at '/'
- ✅ Login flow navigates to HomeScreen.routeName after success
- ✅ SignUp flow preserved
- ✅ MaintenanceLog route preserved
- ✅ Database helper functionality intact
- ✅ Notification scheduling intact

## Known Limitations

For production use, you may want to:
1. Add actual authentication persistence (check if user is logged in on app start)
2. Replace mock data in Upcoming Maintenance with real database queries
3. Replace mock data in Recent Activity with real maintenance log entries
4. Implement actual preference saving
5. Implement actual sign out functionality
6. Wire up Backup/Export Data action

But for the current implementation, all placeholder data ensures the app compiles and runs without errors.
